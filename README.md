## Project Status

⚠️ **This project is no longer actively maintained.** ⚠️

Hey everyone, big thanks to all of you who have used and still use WireGUI.

I wanted to let you know that I've moved away from using WireGuard (I don't need to use it anymore), so I won't be updating WireGUI for now.

However, if anyone wants to pitch in and improve WireGUI, I'd be more than happy to check out your pull requests.
